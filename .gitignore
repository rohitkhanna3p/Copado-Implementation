#if you are not customizing a managed package, you can keep your repository clean by ignoring
#all files for that package. For example, to ignore all files of the "Copado" managed package
#just add to your gitignore file the following text: *copado__*
#if you will be customizing managed packages, make sure that the same version of the package
#is installed on all your environments so that deployments will only update existing
#managed components. Creation of managed components is not permitted by the API.
#It is recommended that you ignore managed components that cannot be modified
#since there is no need to track them in Git, like for example:

# Copado Deployer base package
classes/copado__*
triggers/copado__*
pages/copado__*

# Copado Quality Integration Framework
classes/copadoQuality__*
triggers/copadoQuality__*
pages/copadoQuality__*


#Translations are complex since get updated indirectly across multiple files, they can make a deployment fail
#if a field is translated in source and it doesn't exist on destination.
